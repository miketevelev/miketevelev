### Hey! I'm Mike ğŸ‘‹

I am a "beginner" engineer. I started studying IT 2 years ago.

- ğŸŒ± Currently learning: Rust
- âœ¨ Already know: Intermediate Java & Python and little C & C++
- ğŸ”­ Want to study: Haskel

ğŸ¤” I'm thinking of starting a blog about what I've learned and what I'd like to share. That's all for now.
