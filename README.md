### Hey! I'm Mike ğŸ‘‹

I am a "beginner" engineer. I started studying IT 2 years ago.

ğŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning: Java
âœ¨ Already Know: Intermediate Python and little C
ğŸ”­ I want to study: C++

ğŸ¤” I'm thinking of starting a blog about what I've learned and what I'd like to share. That's all for now.
